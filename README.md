# Huffman Encoder

## Overview

The Huffman Encoder is a Python program designed to compress and decompress data using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a widely used method for lossless data compression that assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters, resulting in efficient encoding and decoding.

## Features

- Generate Huffman encoding table using keyword "CRYPT", "SKY" and first two consonants of input name using Huffman coding.
- Easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
    - `customtkinter`
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`

## Installation

To use the Huffman Encoder, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fang1217/huffman-encoder.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd huffman-encoder
```

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

### Using the Graphical User Interface

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
